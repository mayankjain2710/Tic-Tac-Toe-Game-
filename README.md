# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a simple yet classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides an interactive experience where two players can compete against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.

# Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same device.

Responsive design: Compatible with different screen sizes and devices.

Winning detection: Automatically detects a win, draw, or ongoing game status.

Clean and minimalist design: A simple, easy-to-navigate interface.

# Technologies Used

HTML: Used for structuring the game board and layout.

CSS: Styling the game board, buttons, and other elements for a pleasant visual experience.

JavaScript: Contains the game logic, including player turns, checking for wins or draws, and resetting the game.

# How to Play

The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move by clicking on an empty cell in the grid.

Player 2 (O) takes the next turn by clicking on an empty cell.

The players alternate turns until one player achieves three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

The game announces the result and offers an option to restart for a new game.

Feel free to explore the game by cloning the repository. Feedback and contributions are always appreciated!
